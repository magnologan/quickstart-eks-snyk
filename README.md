# Snyk controller for Amazon EKS

Snyk controller for Amazon EKS enables you to import and test your running EKS workloads and identify vulnerabilities in 
their associated images and configurations that might make those workloads less secure. Once imported, Snyk continues 
to monitor those workloads, identifying additional security issues as new images are deployed and the workload 
configuration changes.

For architectural details, best practices, step-by-step instructions, and customization options, see the [deployment guide](https://aws-quickstart.github.io/quickstart-eks-snyk/).
